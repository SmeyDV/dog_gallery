      <strong>The Golden Retriever</strong> is a Scottish breed of retriever dog of medium size. It is characterised by a gentle and
      affectionate nature and a striking golden coat. It is commonly kept as a pet and is among the most frequently
      registered breeds in several Western countries. It is a frequent competitor in dog shows and obedience trials; it is
      also used as a gundog, and may be trained for use as a guide dog.
      he breed was created by Sir Dudley Marjoribanks at his Scottish estate Guisachan in the late nineteenth century. He
      cross-bred Flat-coated Retrievers with Tweed Water Spaniels, with some further infusions of Red Setter, Labrador
      Retriever and Bloodhound. The breed was recognised by the Kennel Club in 1913, and during the interwar period spread
      to many parts of the world.
